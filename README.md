I am a seasoned mechatronics engineer with 17+ years of business development and program management experience in the automotive sector. Recognized for demonstrating a natural aptitude for leading complex design projects that exceed all expectations, as well as for creating novel solutions to mitigate project risks, I have a verifiable history of contributing directly to company growth and expansion throughout my career. As such, I have consistently exceeded performance goals and I am adept at achieving maximum operational output with minimal resource expenditure. 

Professional focal points include team leadership, entrepreneurship, process improvement, tools and technology, data modeling, multitasking, and adaptability. Delivering superior administration on the latter areas of expertise requires utilization of effective communication skills and problem-solving skills, as well as business acumen, systems analysis, project management and resource management to support efficiency and maximum returns. 

Currently, I am Technical Business Development Manager for Vitesco Technologies. Under my leadership, I oversee business development for start-ups in Electrical Vehicles, Fuel Cells (FC), and micro-mobility domain systems categories. In addition, I liaise with senior leadership, team members, and clients to ensure the companyâ€™s business development support structure is driving the business forward with minimal expenditures.

Colleagues describe me as a progressive, driven, down-to-earth, technical and managerial expert who can be relied on to offer superior solutions that deliver profitable results on time and under budget.

I am interested in contacting former colleagues and managers, as well as other professionals in my field. Feel free to contact me [via email](mailto:seokleeuk@gmail.com) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/seoklee).
